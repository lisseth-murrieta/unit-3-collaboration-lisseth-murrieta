### Tree Identification Tool
You can use this **Javascript** function to identify a tree by its characteristic:

```
    function identity_tree(lead_shape, region){
     if (leaf_shape == "needle" && region == "cold"){
        return "Pine Tree"
    } else if (leaf_shape == "broad" && region == "temperature"){
        return "Oak Tree"
    } else {
        return "Unknown Tree"
    }
}

console.log(identity_tree("needle", "cold")}
```
